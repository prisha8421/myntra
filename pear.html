                    The pear body type is characterized by narrower shoulders and a smaller bust compared to wider hips and thighs.
                    The key to dressing this body type is to balance the lower half while accentuating the upper body to create a more
                    proportionate silhouette.
                </p>

                <h2>Highlighting the Top Half:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strapless Dresses:</strong> These draw attention to your shoulders and upper body, creating a more balanced silhouette. Look for styles with a fitted bodice for a defined waist. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/strapless-dresses" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Sweetheart Necklines:</strong> This neckline dips slightly in the center, adding a touch of femininity and drawing the eye upwards. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/sweetheart-necklines" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Bold Necklines:</strong> V-necks, scoop necks, and halter necks can elongate your neck and torso, creating a more balanced look. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/bold-necklines" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Creating Balance with the Lower Half:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A-Line Dresses:</strong> This classic style creates a balanced silhouette by gradually widening from the bodice towards the hem. It flatters pear shapes by balancing wider hips with a narrower upper body. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/a-line-dresses" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Empire Waist Dresses:</strong> The high waistline draws attention to your bust and skims over your hips, creating a more proportionate look. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/empire-waist-dresses" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Minimizing Hips (Subtle Options):</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shift Dresses:</strong> These loose-fitting dresses can be a comfortable option, but choose styles with interesting necklines or details on the sleeves to add visual interest and avoid drawing attention to the hips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wrap Dresses (with caution):</strong> While wrap dresses can be flattering for many body types, for pear shapes, choose styles with a v-neck and avoid overly flowy skirts to prevent adding volume to the hips.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Materials:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structured Fabrics:</strong> Choose fabrics with some structure like cotton or linen for dresses that skim over your curves without clinging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drapey Fabrics (for Top Half):</strong> For the bodice area, consider flowy fabrics like chiffon or georgette to add a touch of softness and balance the proportions.</li>
                </ul>
