                    The apple body type is characterized by a fuller upper body, including a broader bust and waistline,
                    with narrower hips and legs. The key to dressing this body type is to accentuate the legs and create
                    balance by drawing attention away from the midsection.
                </p>
                <h2>Emphasis on the Top Half:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Empire Waist Dresses:</strong> These have a high waistline that sits just below the bust, creating a flowy silhouette that skims over the midsection. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/empire-waist-dresses" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Wrap Dresses:</strong> The wrap style creates a defined waistline and cinches the figure without being too tight. Look for dresses with a v-neckline to elongate your neck and torso. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/wrap-dresses" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Creating Balance:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A-Line Dresses:</strong> This is a classic style that creates a balanced silhouette by gradually widening from the bodice towards the hem. It flatters most body types, including apple shapes. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/a-line-dresses" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Fit and Flare Dresses:</strong> Similar to A-line, these dresses hug the bodice and then flare out from the waist, creating a more defined waist and balancing the proportions. <a href="https://www.myntra.com/fit-and-flare-dresses" class="explore-btn">Explore</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Additional Considerations:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dresses with Ruching or Draping:</strong> Gentle ruching or draping around the midsection can help to camouflage any fullness in that area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Stripes:</strong> Opt for dresses with vertical stripes as they can create an illusion of a slimmer figure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Materials:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drapey Fabrics:</strong> Lightweight, flowy fabrics like chiffon, georgette, or rayon will drape nicely over your curves without adding bulk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knit Fabrics:</strong> Soft, stretchy knit fabrics can be comfortable and flattering, especially for casual dresses. Look for dresses with a bit of structure to avoid clinging too tightly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structured Fabrics:</strong> Opt for structured fabrics like cotton or linen with a bit of give, especially for empire waist or shift dresses. They will help to maintain the shape of the dress.</li>
                </ul>
